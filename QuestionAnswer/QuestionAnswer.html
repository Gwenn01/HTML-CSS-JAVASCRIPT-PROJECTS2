                In JavaScript, 'null' and 'undefined' both represent the absence of a value, but they are used in slightly different contexts. 'Null' is a deliberate assignment, indicating that a variable has no value or that it has been explicitly set to 'null' by the developer. 'Undefined,' on the other hand, typically means that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value, or it may be the result of trying to access properties or variables that don't exist. It's important to note that 'null' is a value, while 'undefined' is a type

                Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It promotes the use of objects to model real-world entities and their interactions. OOP principles include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (object). Inheritance allows for the creation of new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their properties and behaviors. Polymorphism enables the use of different classes or objects interchangeably, providing flexibility and extensibility in code design.

                Version control is a system that tracks changes made to a set of files over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, keep a history of changes, and revert to previous states if needed. Version control systems, such as Git, provide a structured and organized way to manage code, enabling team members to work on different aspects of a project concurrently without conflicts. It also helps in error detection, code collaboration, documentation, and maintaining code quality over time. Version control is a fundamental tool in modern software development, ensuring the integrity and reliability of codebases.
